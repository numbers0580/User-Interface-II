                <p>Hello. My name is Peter Wood. I have been passionate about programming for most of my life now. It started innocently enough: playing video games as a kid. I just wanted to make them better. High school offered me Programming classes. I was the only student in my school to complete Programming I through Programming IV. Then I found that real-life is nothing like high school. When able, I continued teaching myself various languages because I wanted to get all the crazy ideas out of my head in the only way I know how: making games. Don't get me wrong, I'm able to make practical apps, as well. However, I have no artistic ability: I can't draw, and I don't know what colors or themes pair well with others, so I'm rudimentary at best in designing, but instead I have excelled in the areas of artificial intelligence and error-proofing. My room might be a mess, but my code never is.</p>
